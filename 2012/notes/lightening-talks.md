# "Functional Reactive Programming in ClojureScript with Flapjax", Alan Dipert #

## FRP ##
* Programming paradigm
  * Set of language and/or library features
* Key idea
  * Time-varying values: event stream reference types
  * Stream composition: work with events like seqs
    * ... instead of callbacks (or watches)

## Existing things ##
* Not very good
* Use flapjax

## Where FRP helps ##
* Events: user, DOM, scheduled/periodic
  * Generation, consumption
  * Conditional propagation, fusion, filtering
  * Wiring
* No structural composition, templating
* No CSS

## DEMO ##

## Conclusion ##
* Can be used in Clojure in general
* Working on a ClojureScript port
