# "Whence Complexity?", Mike Nygard #

## Introduction ##
* Some things that look simple have a lot of hidden complexity
* Consider Applebee's
  * Consider fried chicken from Applebee's
  * Where does the chicken come from?
  * Giant warehouses
  * Centralized supply chain management
  * Huge network of organisations involved
  * Chickens, like other raw materials live right out on the periphery
* These are upstream components
* There is a downstream aswell
  * Applebee's has waste
  * For example, used frying oil collection companies 
* Corn industry
  * Two companies at the top
  * Ended up with too much corn
  * Built high-fructose corn syrup industry on top of this
  * Built restaurant industry on top of this
  * Lobbied government to require some ethanol production from corn
* The trouble is this is all untrue
* Teleology
  * It's very difficult to design a system as complex as this
* Evolution
  * Chain of restaurants, a couple of stores do something slightly
    different, many die out, that something different helps those
    stores to survive. If the chain starts to boom again, through
    accidental or intentional copying, the number of stores doing that
    thing differently increases. Ad infinitum.  

## Variation ##
* Randomness in the outcome of a process
* Randomness inevitably enters any physical or temporal process
* Ergodicity: assume that 1000 samples for 1 month is equivalent to 1
  sample for 1000 months
* Statisticity: we know the past we only have a probability for the future

## Selection ##
* Differential effects produce differential outcomes.
* Deliberate selection
  * Process evolution
  * Plan, do, measure, act
* Genotype, phenotype selection
  * Genotype: ideas behind how to run the company
  * Phenotype: realisation of those ideas...selected too

## Iteration ##
* Events happen just once, but processes continue while inputs remain
  available
* A system which iterates faster will adapt faster to its environment
  than a system which iterates more slowly.

## Coupling ##
* Outputs become inputs, possibly catalysts
* Coupling is everywhere in the universe
* We draw boundaries and pretend that bounded system is uncoupled from
  everything else.

## Constraint ##
* Real processes encounter limits in inputs, capacity or throughput
* Sometimes the constraints aren't the ones you imagine

## Negentropic Dynamics ##

## Combinations ##
* Iteration + Selection + Variation
  * Web business
* Coupling + Iteration
  * Population explosion
* Coupling + Iteration + Constraint
  * Population collapse
  * The constraint makes things go non-linear, the catastrophe manifold
* Variation + Selection + Coupling
  * Black-Scholes formula for option pricing
  * Black swans, a very unexpected effect where things you thought
    would be uncoordinated become coordinated and start heading in the
    same direction

## Processes ##
* Lean
* Theory of constraints
* Six Sigma
* Agile development
* Maneuver warfare
* Combine to give complexity theory

## Six Sigma ##
* Process changes: variation + iteration + selection
* No constraint and coupling
* Can be a lot more efficent but it doesn't matter because you have no inputs

## Maneuver Warfare ##
* Battlefield actions: variation, iteration, selection, coupling,
constraint
* Compare with battlefield warfare based on relative losses

## Theory of Constraints ##
* Constraint, variation, iteration, coupling
* Applied to software, we can get to a stage where production exceeds demand, pushes the constraint downstream

## Flow (2nd Generation Lean) ##
* All 5

## Aside ##
* Vital vs. suffocating?
* Every complex working system began as a small system that worked

## Queues ##
* Coupling + constraint, damps variation
* Kanban, minimise flow
* Zero queue size can exaggerate noise

## Opinion on Variability ##
* Theory of constraints: against
* Maneuver warfare: embraces
* Others: against
* One model - 50/50, reinforce positive variations

## Looking Forward ##
* Dynamic processes do not have goals
* Beware teleological explanations
* You are not the point of evolution
* Survival of an individual specimen or whole system is not guaranteed
